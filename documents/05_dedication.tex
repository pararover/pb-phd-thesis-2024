\chapter*{DEDICATION}
    \def\baselinestretch{1.0}
    \par\textsl{In the unfolding of my academic pursuit, I often find myself contemplating upon the nature of $\pi$ -- the enigmatic constant that governs circles, yet never reveals its full form. Much like the arc of $\pi$, the path of knowledge curves toward deeper understanding without ever reaching a final resolution. Each decimal of $\pi$ mirrors the layers of discovery within my research, wherein every insight leads to another, and certainty seems to lie just beyond the horizon. It is in this endless quest for completeness, knowing that some mysteries may remain forever irrational, that I have found meaning in both the struggle and the pursuit.}
