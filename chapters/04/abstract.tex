    This chapter presents a new analysis of high-resolution X-ray spectra of the astronomical object RX J0925.7-4758, obtained using the XMM-Newton observatory's RGS instrument. We employ spectral fitting using a model grid to ascertain the one that accurately represents the observed data. Our analysis focuses on a subset of pre-defined models, evaluating their fit quality using the reduced chi-squared statistic $\chi^2_\text{reduced}$). We find that model M11 provides the best fit ($1<\chi^2_\text{reduced}<2$) for spectra from both RGS1 and RGS2 instruments, across all observed spectral orders. This signifies a significant improvement compared to previous studies on RX J0925.7-4758, which faced challenges in modeling the object's X-ray emission using a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) atmosphere model. The model M11 incorporates several components, including interstellar medium (ISM) absorption, intrinsic X-ray emission with separate contributions from cold gas absorption and an NLTE atmosphere, thermal plasma emission from potentially two different mechanisms, and a wind or outflow component. This comprehensive model suggests a more accurate capture of the physical processes governing the X-ray emission from RX J0925.7-4758.
