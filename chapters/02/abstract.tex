    This chapter presents a comprehensive methodology for analyzing the spectral and variability characteristics of Supersoft X-ray Sources (SSS). The spectral analysis section delves into the fundamentals of spectral curve fitting, including model-based fitting, the $\chi^2$ statistic, and parameter estimation. The essential components and data preprocessing steps involved in spectral analysis are also outlined. The variability study section focuses on the application of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram for identifying and characterizing periodic signals within SSS lightcurves. The methodology includes data acquisition, preprocessing, periodogram calculation, statistical significance assessment, phase-folding, and sinusoidal fitting. By combining these techniques, this chapter provides a robust framework for extracting valuable insights into the spectral and variability properties of SSS.
